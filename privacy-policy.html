            <p>
              We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
              necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless
              a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
              tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). When we have no
              ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
              information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is
              not possible (for example, because your personal information has
              been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your
              personal information and isolate it from any further processing
              until deletion is possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              Customer Data retention is governed by the agreement between
              Maintafox and the Customer.
            </p>
